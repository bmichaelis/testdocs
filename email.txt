Northridge PTA will be hosting a Reading Program Winter Event.  Our goal in hosting this event is to encourage our students to engage in reading 300,000 min. in a 3-week period of time. In order to accomplish this task we have come up with incentives and fun activities to do throughout this time. 
We will use the month of January to collect books of all genres you donate to a bookstore our students earn credit for. On February 23rd, we will kick off a 3 week read-a-thon. Reading minutes will become treasure as ships sail across our PTA Treasure Map on their quest to reach the Red X. When the final ship has conquered all and our school has accomplished what seems to be an impossible task we will be privileged to see a premiere showing from Kid History. (you can see one of their "Kid Snippets" here at www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdxEAt91D7k)
Look for more information in the January newsletter.
