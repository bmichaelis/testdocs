The Northridge PTA will be hosting a Reading Program Winter Event. Our goal is to encourage our students to engage in reading. To measure engagement, we will set a collective goal of 300,000 min. over the course of a 3-week period. In order to accomplish this goal, we have come up with incentives and fun activities to do throughout this time. 

We will use the month of January to collect book donations of all genres. The donated books will be used in a bookstore where students will be able to purchase books with credits that they have earned. On February 23rd, we will kick off a 3 week read-a-thon. Reading minutes will become treasure as ships sail across our PTA Treasure Map on their quest to reach the Red X. When the final ship has conquered all and our school has accomplished what seems to be an impossible task we will be privileged to see a premiere showing from Kid History. (you can see one of their "Kid Snippets" here at www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdxEAt91D7k)
Look for more information in the January newsletter.
